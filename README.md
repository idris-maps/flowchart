# flowchart

[Flowchart](https://flowchart.surge.sh) is a tool to easily draw relations between nodes. The resulting [SVG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics) is unopinionated enough to integrate seamlessly in your design. 

The minimal features are intended. If you are looking for something fancy, checkout [graphviz](https://graphviz.org) or [mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid).
